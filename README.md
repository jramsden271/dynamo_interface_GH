# dynamo_interface_GH
A modified Attributes file for GH custom components. Creates a Dynamo-like interface for custom compiled components.

Add the CustomAttributes file to your Grasshopper project in Visual Studio. The Example_Usage shows how to implement the custom attributes into the component itself. Basically, you're looking for the CreateAttributes override.
